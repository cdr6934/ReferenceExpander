Good evening. It's good to see everyone here tonight, it's a great day to be able to worship God. And I'm so glad to be able to be back to a little bit more normal service here with having the two services in the morning and night. So it's good to be with you. And I'm glad to be able to worship with you tonight. In September of 2019, there was a new bronze sculpture by Timothy schmaltz, and it was installed at St. Peter's Square in the Vatican. This sculpture is a 20 foot long sculpture that shows a group of men, women and children, they're standing shoulder to shoulder, and they represent different cultures and historical time periods. Despite these many differences that they have, they have one thing in common, and that is that they are all migrants or refugees. The migrants include a Jew that was fleeing from Nazi Germany, a Syrian that was fleeing and running from the Civil War, a pole that was escaping the communist regime, and then also an African that was escaping warlords and dictators in his country. The name of the sculpture is called angels unawares. And while it may look like a normal group of people, you may see two things protruding from the top there. Those are angel's wings, angel's wings, the name of this sculpture takes its name from Hebrews 13 And verse two, which says, Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers. For thereby, some have entertained angels on a weighers angels unawares. I'd like to talk for just a few moments tonight about foreigners about what the Bible has to say about foreigners and what we can learn about foreigners in Scripture, both what God thinks, and then also how we should think about that, you know, there's a lot of input in our world about foreigners. And I think there's a lot of places we could get our understanding of that politics has a lot to say, if you go on the internet, there's a lot of people that have a lot of things to say about foreigners. society at large has something to say, but we need, we need to go to Scripture. And we need to look to Scripture to see what it has to say, and what should develop our mindset set there. You know, as we think about foreigners, sometimes it can be a little bit uncomfortable. You know, it's only natural that we gravitate toward people that we're comfortable with people that are like us. And so foreigners and normally we think of national foreigners, but really, we could use this word and in a variety of ways, those that are different from us in some way. Whether it be their language, their nationality, their background, their culture, their economic status, there are those that are foreign to us. And so we need to consider what it is that would apply here, consider how we would look to Scripture. Before I get into this lesson, I'll mention one of the things I love about Broadmoor is that there are so many good Bible students here. So many people that I respect. True workman. I'll just mention one of those. And that's Terry. I knew that she had done a lot of thinking about foreigners. So I asked her to give me some of her thoughts. And she did. And I couldn't put everything she had in the lesson. In fact, if you want to learn more about foreigners talk to Terry, even after this lesson, I'm sure she'll help you out even more, but I appreciate her and her help. There. Okay, with all that said, let's jump into the lesson. First of all, notice God's response to foreigners, how does God view and treat foreigners? Well, the first thing we might notice is that God loves foreigners. God loves foreigners. In Deuteronomy 10 And verse 18. It states this. He executes justice for the fatherless and the widow and loves the sojourner giving him food and clothing. One of the things we'll notice in Scripture is that there's a few synonyms we might notice for a foreigner, it could say a foreign or it may say a sojourner. Israelite would have people that would sojourn and they would be foreign people that would travel through so often we see the word Sojourner, and sometimes it might say, or use the word a stranger. But we see in Deuteronomy 10 And verse 18, that God loves the sojourner. God loves the sojourner. Now this list that he provides here is certainly not exclusive. It's not that He only loves the fatherless, the widow and Sojourner, but I think there's reason that he makes special note of these individuals. These were vulnerable people in society, those that were often left out, those that did not always have the support system and the help that they needed. And so God makes a special note to say that he loves the fatherless, the widow. And yes, the foreigner, the stranger. And Deuteronomy 24, verses 14 through 22. There it gets into more instructions about how Israelites were to treat the foreigner. Notice in Deuteronomy 24, in verse 14, you shall not oppress a hired worker who is poor and needy, whether he is one of your own brothers or one of the sojourners who are in your land within your towns, Do not oppress the foreigner, don't take advantage of the foreigner. And you can see how easy that would be to take advantage of someone that doesn't know the customs, the way things are done. He says, Do not take advantage. And verse 17, he says, You shall not pervert the Justice due to the sojourner or to the fatherless, or take a widow's garment and pledge, but you show remember that you were a slave in Egypt, and the Lord your God redeemed you from there. Therefore, I command you to do this. One of the easiest ways that we can vilify or push other people aside is if we say there's us, and then we put people into two groups. You know, I know what I'm like, I'm part of the good group, but those people over there. And that has been a tactic of Satan for years and years to put people into the other group and to push them to the side. But notice what God does hear in this text, he says that you are no different than that foreigner. And as Christians, aren't we to be foreign, in a sense to this world? Well, certainly we are. We are strangers, and pilgrims through this land. So certainly, we should, should have our hearts go out to those that are physically so. And that's what God calls the Israelites to do. Remember, you were a slave in Egypt. As we move on in verse 17, through 21, he says, when you when you reap your harvest, don't get every single last scrap. In fact, if there's a little bit of leftovers, if there are scraps that are there, you leave that there for the fatherless, the widow and the sojourner. And when it comes to getting all those from the trees, you leave a little bit there for them and grapes from the vineyard leave a little bit there for them. It shall be it says at the end of 21, it shall be for the sojourner, the fatherless and the widow. In verse 23, you shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, therefore I command you. To do this. God reminds the Israelites that they were foreigners. And so he points to the actions that they are to have. But as we look at this, notice, God loves the foreigner. God loves the foreigner. God also calls the foreigner God calls the foreigner, because of His great love for them, He wants them to be saved. And so he calls them to be in a relationship with him to know who he is to know who he is. This was true in Egypt, we often see God and the gods of Egypt, or maybe even Pharaoh who claimed themselves to be a God and true opposition. They were in conflict. And the Mighty God, of course, won that conflict. And God, one of the things he wanted to do within the Exodus and bringing the plagues is he wanted the knowledge of who he is to go forth, particularly among the Israelites. He wanted Israel to know that he is the God of heaven, but that's not all. God also wanted the Egyptians to know that he wanted to come to one of them to come to a knowledge of that, and Exodus seven and verse 14, as God is preparing Moses to go and talk to Pharaoh and and to deal with him. He says, this, Pharaoh will not listen to you. Then I will lay my hand on Egypt and bring my hosts, my people, the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by great acts of judgment. The Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord when I stretch out my hand against Egypt and bring out the people of Israel from among them. Yes, God was going to do mighty things and he wanted His people Israel to know about him, but he also wanted the Egyptians to be impressed with God's power with His character with who he is. And I think that they were when they saw what had happened. In fact, this news not only spread within Egypt, but it extended out and spread out. as Israel was traveling to the promised land and traveling even into the promised land. There were those that had heard about what God had done. And I think that's God's intention. He wanted them to know about him. Rahab was one of the citizens of Jericho. And when the spies two spies from Israel came this is as Israel was knocking on the door, ready to enter into the promised land. She was an inhabitant of Canaan. She was a forerunner, but she takes the spies and she hides them. And in Joshua two and verse nine, she says this, I know that the Lord has given you the land, and that the fear of you has fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land melt away before you in verse 10, she says that we have heard about and she says two things. We've heard about the fact that you crossed the Red Sea. And after that crossing, we saw that you defeated the the kings of the Amorites. So now that they've crossed the Jordan, what do you think she's thinking they're going to do? Defeat the people. And so she says, we've heard about that, in verse 11. She says this, For the Lord your God, He is God in the heavens above, and on the earth beneath. God wants foreigners to know who he is, and to know his name. And so he calls foreigners. Notice also that God uses foreigners, and he uses foreigners within his purposes and for his purposes. Actually, before I get to that, I want to notice a few other just a quick list. And again, there are so many examples in Scripture, but I'll give you some of these, just like Rahab proclaimed the God of Israel. There are many others that did this. You might think about the Queen of Sheba, and First Kings 10 And verse nine, bless it be the Lord your God, who has delighted in you and set you on the throne of Israel. Because the Lord loved Israel forever. He has made you king that you may execute justice and righteousness of foreign individual proclaiming the God of heaven. When God told Jonah to go speak to the Ninevites, we know that he resisted at first but in chapter three, he does go and speak to the Ninevites. And how did they respond? The text says that they believed the God of heaven, and the people have never believed God. And then it says, And they repented in sackcloth and ashes. Yes, foreigners, proclaim the truth of who God is. And the days of Jesus, we see the Syrophoenician woman, she believed in Jesus power to say, so much so that she persisted in her pursuit of his, his power there. And in Luke seven, in verse nine, we see the centurion, who requested the healing of His servants. And he was commended. When Jesus says, I tell you, not even in Israel have I found such great faith. Those are just a sprinkling. There are many, many others that we could mention. But God calls foreigners and wants them to know who he is. God also uses foreigners, he uses foreigners within his purposes. In Genesis chapter 12, we see that God makes foundational promises to Abraham, promising to make him a great name, to make out of him a great nation, and that ultimately, he would bring forth the seed in Israel that would bring salvation to all people. When God brings about this nation through Abraham, that would be his special people. And so as God selected them, a lot of those that are outside of that nation are foreigners. I think sometimes we misunderstand that, that when God gave those promises, that he was restricting his blessings to just the nation of Israel. But that's actually not so. In Genesis 12. And verse three, it says in in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed. God chose Abraham and Israel that would ultimately lead to Jesus Christ not to restrict his blessings, but so that all people might have those blessings. God's intent was not just to have a national religion, but God's intent was for all people to know who God is. But he used that channel. He used that teaching lesson he used that nation to bring about those purposes. But not only did he use Abraham and the chosen line he also used Foreigners to bring about his purposes. We can see this in the very genealogy of Jesus in Matthew chapter one. Matthew chapter one and verse one, the first verse of the New Testament, the book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the Son of David, the son of Abraham. And as we begin the the list of the genealogies, the ancestors of Jesus, we see that it starts with Abraham, and it continues on. You'll notice in verse three, it says, And Judah, the father of Perez and Zerah by Tamar and prayers, the father of Hebron has run and has run the father of RAM, and ram the Father, father of a minute, Dan, I thought my verse was verse three, but I need to go verse five, I didn't intend to read the whole list there. But there's not much more left we have named Shawn. And then it gets in verse four, named Shawn the father of Salomon, and verse five, and Salomon, the father of Boaz by Rahab. And Boaz, the father of Obon, by Ruth, and Ovid, the father of Jesse, and Jesse, the father of David, the king. Notice two individuals that he uses here, and they were foreigners. They were foreign women, they were outside the line, but God used them to bring about his purposes. The first one that's mentioned there in verse five is Rahab. And we just saw that she hid the spies, she helped deliver them, so that they could bring back word of what was happening in Jericho, and she proclaim the true God of heaven. And after she left her her life of prostitution after Israel saved her, she married and had a family, a very important family within the line of Jesus Christ. She was the great great grandmother, if I have that right of King David. Not only that, but we see that Boaz was the father of obeyed by Ruth by Ruth. Ruth also was a foreigner. She was not an Israelite. She married Israelite children, the children of Elimelech are one of the children, one of the sons, but she was a mo abiertas. And she displayed great faith that she followed her mother in law. In fact, we see that she made a statement of loyalty to her and Ruth one in verse 16, she says, Do not urge me to leave you or to return from following you for where you go, I will go and where you lodge, I will urge your people shall be my people and your God, my God. She gave up the prospects what it seemed like at the time prospects for a husband for herself, and she did that to care for her mother in law. But we see not only that, God use individuals, you can even step back God uses nations doesn't mean and I'm not belabor this point, real long. But in Psalm 22, in verse 28, there it says that God is the Ruler over the nations, and Daniel to his, as Daniel speaks the dreams that God gives to him, he points to the future of four kingdoms that will stand and fall. And it's in the days of the fourth kingdom, that the that God will establish a special kingdom that will not be destroyed. And we see there the church and Daniel to in verse 21. It says he changes times and seasons. He removes kings and sets up kings, he gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge to those who have understanding. Yes, God reigns and uses not only individual foreigners, but all nations, all nations and all kings are subject to God's majesty and to His sovereignty. You might even think about Cyrus, who was a ruler from 539 to 530, allow the Israelites to go back from captivity. And Isaiah 45 Verse one it says, Thus says the Lord to His anointed to Cyrus, whose right hand I have grasped, to subdue nations before him and to loosen the belts of kings to open doors before him, that gates may not be closed. Yes, God used individuals according to His purposes, even Cyrus a foreign godless King. This is God's response to foreigners, but he also calls upon us to have a response to foreigners as well we have a responsibility about how we should treat others. So notice first of all, we also should love foreigners. We should love foreigners mean just underscore this point because often we resist, we push away foreigners we say we don't understand or they don't speak my language and there's this natural impulse to push your way. But we have to get over that. We have to love foreigners. Love people because they are made in the image of God. They are people just like we are in Deuteronomy 10 Verse 18, in that passage that says that God loves foreigners and verse 19, Deuteronomy 10. There the passage says love the sojourner, therefore, for you are sojourners in the land of Egypt. God says, I love the sojourner, but he also calls upon Israel, you love the stranger, and the foreigner and Leviticus 19. And I'll simply say, this is a passage that I feel like I've overlooked somehow, but in Leviticus 19 And verse 34, notice what it says, You shall treat the stranger who sojourns with you as the native among you, and you shall love him as yourself, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt. I am the Lord your God. The reason I think I've overlooked that now paid attention to verse 18. The second great commandment there, it seems to be referencing natives those of Israel right says you are to love your neighbor, the Israelites as yourself. But verse 34, said, it's not just the Israelites, it's also the foreigner, the stranger, you are to love them as you love yourself and treat them as the native. I am the Lord your God, what a powerful verse. God says, love them as you love yourself. And so we must practice and show and display love to others. Not only love but kindness, kindness, or hospitality in Hebrews 13 And verse two, do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers, for thereby some have entertained angels unawares. We often think about hospitality today is inviting family, you know, into your home and providing for them. And there's some sense of hospitality in that, and that's a good thing to do. But in the first century, we see that hospitality involved, those that were coming through those that that did not have provisions and providing for them. You see that in the Old Testament in a Bedouin type society is you would have travelers that were going through hospitality was so very important. In fact, this passage references Genesis 18, and 19, where Abraham showed hospitality to two people that were going through, not because of what he could get from them. But because they needed it, and show he showed kindness. So do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers. I think this idea of strangers is kind of embedded in the word of hospitality love of strangers. The simple truth is, we need to understand that, that we may not realize how big of an impact we can have to a stranger, by simply showing kindness by simply showing kindness. I hear people say and I think a lot of people think what can I do? As a Christian, I'm nobody special. I'm nobody important. Well, we're all important in God's eyes. But here's something you can do. You can be kind. And Ruth to in verse 10. When Boaz showed kindness to Ruth, notice how she responded. So she fell on her face. And she says, Why have I found favor in your eyes, that you should take notice of me since I am a foreigner. Notice that society tells foreigners that you're you're to be pushed to the side that you are unimportant. And they hear that message. So what should a Christian do and say to others, we should show kindness, not buy into the world's attitudes, and we should treat them with kindness and they will notice it. I think Jesus calls upon something similar in Matthew 2531, through 46, when he calls upon us to be kind to the vulnerable and lowly there, he says that we are to feed the hungry, to give drink to the thirsty, to clothe the naked, to visit the sick and visit those in prison. And it's not in the form of a command. He actually says that when you do this to the least of these, the lowly, that would include the the stranger witness that would include the foreign when you do that you do that to me. You do that to me. So how important is it that we would show kindness to strangers? How important is it? Well, Jesus says in Matthew 25, our soul depends upon it. If we are to go to the right place and do the right thing and think the right things, and yet we act in an ungodly way too. Those outside, then we're doing a lot wrong. We're doing a lot that's wrong. Our hearts need to be transformed by our doctrine, our understanding of Scripture, not separated and divided. So we have our understanding here, and then our life is something else and something different. And so we need to be, kind, be kind. We also need to be inviting, inviting. In particular, we need to invite others invite foreigners and strangers. We can do that by finding as much common ground as we can. We may think there's not a lot common there. But we're all humans, aren't we? We're all people. We all share a lot. And as we make that common bond, we can invite them to know about what is most important, and that is God. In first Peter three in verse 15, it says, but in your hearts honor Christ as Lord, always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asked you for a reason for the hope that is in you. Yet do it with gentleness and respect, having a good conscience so that when you are slandered those who revile your good behavior in Christ may be put the shame. Notice what's going on here. Christians are different. They look and act different. And they cause questions that come up. Why do you do that? That's going to lead you to persecution that's going to lead to trouble. Why would you do that? And we can answer those questions because we are different. Well, and maybe that someone different is asking us, maybe a foreigner, maybe someone that's outside of our sphere. And we need to be prepared to answer that. I love how it says how we're to do that with gentleness, and with respect. So when we love the foreigner, when we are kind to the foreigner that's going to make it easier when we're answering a question, maybe even from those that opposes that we would do so with love and respect, and with gentleness. And so we are to invite the foreigner, invite them, especially to know God. And acts 17, we see that Paul was speaking to Greeks on Mars Hill. And he says in verse 30, the times of ignorance God overlooked, but he commands all people everywhere to repent, I think God or Paul was inviting these foreigners, to know the true God. And that's found all throughout that chapter, and in the sermon that he gives in Acts 17. So we need to invite the foreign. We also need to learn from the foreigner we need to learn from the foreign you know, sometimes I think we think we have all the knowledge, we have all that there is, knowledge is good. It's not a bad thing, knowledge is good, but but first Corinthians warns us that knowledge can puff up, can puff up it can make arrogant, I think that the foreigner is used in Scripture to counterbalance arrogance that happens upon the part of the faith. And it happens all of the time. We need to learn from foreigners. Foreigners that can show great faith, while the faithful are are falling short. Notice a few examples of this. We have Abraham and Abimelech Abraham had received the promises from God he was the recipient and the receptacle of the promises that would ultimately lead to salvation for all people. He was a man of faith. He believed God's promises and he acted upon those promises. But when he comes to a foreigner and Genesis 20 This is the second time this happens. When it comes to this foreigner he says of his wife, that she is merely my sister. And so have emelec call Sarah and and said, he's going to take her for his wife. And God in a dream warns him not to touch this woman. And there's an exchange that happened between a boom luck and God. And Benelux says, Lord, will you kill an innocent people? After all, and I'm summarizing didn't he say she was the sister didn't she say he was his brother. In the integrity of my hearts and the innocence of my hands, I have done this. Abraham, the faithful man put his wife in a position to be violate. He put not only his wife in that poor position, but he put himself in a position to compromise the promises of God. The seed was dependent upon that relationship. And yet it was a emelec that acted with integrity here. What about the cities of Jebus and Gambia in Judges 19 We see that there is a concubine that leaves her husband. She leaves and she goes to her family and he goes after her. And he gets there and they reconcile and they stay there many days the father in law and Weissman and says stay, and the text kind of goes for one day they plan to leave while he stays another day. Well, and then he stays another day and follow while keeps convincing him to stay. But after six or seven days, he decides it is time to depart and make the journey back. As they're traveling along. He looks to the city of Jebus. And he says, Let us stop here and his master said to him, this is verse 12, judges 19 We will not turn inside into a city of foreigners who do not belong to the people of Israel. But we will pass on to give via they pass this foreign city of Jebus because they want to go to an Israelites, not the foreigners, we're going to go to the faithful. Well, if you know the rest of that story, we know that unspeakable things happened to that concubine. And it happened among the faithful. It happened among the faithful the people of God. You know, I've been fascinated with foreigners in Scripture and how they're used. And this is part because it's very indicting to us as a people, that we would not become arrogant and think because we're within these walls that we're doing right. Everything we're doing is good. Now we need to be warned, and watch our hearts and watch our hearts. Well, there's more. David. David was a king of great promise. His heart was given fully to God. He was the king of Israel. He had conquered many armies. He was doing great things for God. But he fell into the temptation of lust and he spiraled into the depravity of sin and sin after sin after sin because of it. And he calls Bathsheba. He commits sin with Bathsheba and then he tries to hide it. So he calls Bathsheba has husband Uriah, who is a Hittite, who is a foreigner so that he might lay with his wife so that that conceal what David had done after Bashi was found to be pregnant. Uriah doesn't do that. He says, No, but I'm in battle and to stay aside and he doesn't carry through with that. He maintains integrity and seeks to be pure, even in that relationship, and then ultimately, David kills him. In the house of God, David is a murderer. He is an adulterer. He is a liar. He's a thief. And it is Uriah the Hittite. That stands in counterbalance to that, who acts with integrity. He's a foreigner, but he acts with integrity. We find Jonah who is told in Jonah chapter one go and proclaim the Word of the Lord. And instead of going to where he's supposed to, he goes the other way. It goes the opposite direction and tries to get on a, a ship that is headed to Tarsus. And so he encounters some sailors that are there and God's rose hurls a great storm upon that place because of Jonah's disobedience. And we find that the sailors there are praying, they're praying to their God, and they're doing everything they can to keep the boats, you know, on the water, not capsizing. And they've come down and they find Jonah asleep. Not only has he fled from God, but he's not praying and they say, Pray. They understood there's power in this prayer. They believe that ultimately they would begin to proclaim and pray to the true God of Israel. And here we find Jonah who is a prophet of God that has spoken the Word of God and He is fleeing from God. And he is asleep when prayers are needed, but these foreigners are praying to God. Jonah would not lift one finger to save the Ninevites people. But these these sailors do everything they can to save Jonah they don't want to throw him overboard. They resist that. And then finally they have to, but you'll see that these foreign savings provide a lesson and faithfulness to Jonah and to us. We also see the immoral Corinthian in First Corinthians chapter five you remember what it says about him, it says that this is the sin or he was committing a sin of a kind that is not tolerated even among the pagans. When it comes to morality, the world is doing a better job here than this individual in Corinth. And could that be said of us? Could that be said of us? I'm sure, there are many other examples. But it's fascinating to me to look at see how the faithful can learn lessons from, from foreigners from foreigners also mentioned that, that I've tried when I preach, to say things that we need to hear, I probably changed my approach in preaching a little bit over the years, I was taught that preaching was to be militant, that meant that you attacked, now, it would be foolish not to warn of air. You don't you don't send your child out into the street and don't warn of the dangers of what's in the streets. And so I'm not saying it's bad to talk about air to identify it to show the danger that's there. But I think I used to live in attack mode. I was told that the gospel is to be militant. And that's the primary way that we are to preach. Well, there's aspects of militancy. But as I've preached more, I realized that yes, there's some things out there that need to be corrected. But we need to take care of our own hearts. We need to address our own hearts. And yes, invite other people to the gospel. Yes, deal with things that are out there. There's a lot that's wrong in the world. But I don't want to live talking to the foreigners. When the foreigners can sometimes teach me lessons, because I'm too arrogant to notice them. I'm too arrogant to notice them. There is a lot of good with foreigners we should not despise look down on and hate the foreigner. But we should, as God does love the foreigner love who they are. I talked about God's response to foreigners. God loves foreigners, God calls foreigners. God uses foreigners. But there's one more point I want to break. That is that God died for foreigners. God died for foreigners and John 316. For God so loved the world. And that includes every person, doesn't it? Every individual. God so loved the world that He gave His only Son that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life. And Acts chapter two when the gospel was proclaimed first there to the Jews on Pentecost. There, Pierre talks about the promise there and verse 39, the promise that is for your children, and for all who are far off, was the gospel intended to be just for the Jews. So it started there, but the intent was always that it would go to everyone to those that are far off those that that are outside the Jewish religion and ancestry. And so he says to go to all people, the Gospel begins to be proclaimed and it's proclaimed to foreigners the Samaritans were treated like outsiders so much so that in John five when the woman in a well heard Jesus speaking to her she almost doubletake. Are you talking to me kind of like Ruth? Are you showing me this kindness but I'm a foreigner, don't you understand and realize, and yet in Acts, chapter eight, the Gospel went to the Samaritans. And they could believe the message and be a part of the children of God. And Acts chapter 10. We see Cornelius Sara, before I leave x eight, the unit, you may notice that the court was arranged the quarter the temple was arranged with the the Holy of Holies, the holy place and as it extended out, you find that the Jewish men could come in here this is a terrier point. The Jewish men could come in here and then you have the quarter of the gentiles on the outside. What did it say about the the Unix? Well, the Unix we're not allowed to enter into the Assembly of God. No, the foreign person or one that had been mutilated, it says could be able to enter in. But yet we find in the New Testament the gospel is proclaimed even to the eunuch fully invited in to the gospel message. God died for foreigners. God died for you. And he died for me and x 10. We find the the example of Cornelius as well as the gospel continued to spread to other Gentiles those that were not of the household. I hope this lesson has been helpful for you to help direct your mindsets toward other people and your actions and your actions. I know that it's been helpful for me to study. I know if you get into the subject, there's a lot more you could look at. This is touching the hem of the garment. Well, we have an opportunity tonight to obey the gospel message. If you're here tonight and you're not a Christian, you can do exactly what that Ethiopian eunuch did. You can hear the gospel message, believe that Jesus is the Christ, repent of your sins, confess Jesus as the Christ and be baptized in the water for forgiveness of sins. If you're here tonight, and you are a Christian, but maybe your heart is not what it should be, or you're not living a good impure life, you're living in sin, whatever the situation is, we would love to help you. There's any subject to them. tation please come as we stand in saying this time
